Sensitive customer data or confidential business trade secrets can be leaked by employees using vulnerable web applications; applications that can be exploited by attackers using code injection to trick users and redirect them towards phishing or malicious sites. Recent research shows that the majority of cyber attacks are done at the web application level. Knowing what web applications are running on the network and what risk ratings they have is critical for the administrators to determine the appropriate policies for these applications.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">The following section shows the top 25 web applications with their application risk ratings, sorted by bandwidth usage.</span></p><fazchart mkey=\"Apprisk-Ctrl-Top-Web-Applications-by-Bandwidth\" title=\" \" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><em>Figure 7: Top 25 web applications sorted by bandwidth</em></span></p><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1>Web Categories In Use</h1><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Identifying which web categories and websites are accessed by applications provides additional data points for administrators to understand the network traffic usage.

Once an application vulnerability has been found, the attacker can exploit it to facilitate a cyber crime. These crimes often target the confidential data of a business, or availability of business resources and services. The visibility into application vulnerability exploits enables the administrator to take immediate action against a threat and to protect business assets. It also helps the administrator to tighten the policies for vulnerable applications.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">The FortiGuard research team analyses application traffic patterns and application vulnerabilities and then develops signatures to prevent the vulnerability exploits. The FortiGuard Intrusion Prevention Service (IPS) provides Fortinet customers with the latest defenses against stealthy network-level threats. It uses a customizable database of more than 5,100 known threats to stop attacks that evade traditional firewall systems. It also provides behavior based heuristics analysis to enable the FortiGate systems to recognize zero-day attacks.

Malware often targets sensitive personal, financial, or business information for monetary gain. For a malware to accomplish its goals, it must be able to run without being detected. Providing visibility into applications on the network, and the ability to detect/block malware helps administrators to guard the business assets and stop imminent threats.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">The FortiGuard AntiVirus Service employs advanced virus, spyware, and heuristic detection engines to enable FortiGate systems to detect and prevent both new and evolving threats.

Commonly used applications such as web browsers and e-mail client applications are often targeted for the zero-day exploits because of their widespread distribution and usage; for example, attacks can send a zero-day malware as e-mail attachments which exploit vulnerabilities in the application opening the attachment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">FortiGuard research team proactively monitors threat landscape and looks for zero-day vulnerabilities; once a zero-day vulnerability is identified, an advanced signature(s) is developed and pushed out to the customers before a vendor&rsquo;s patch release is available. These signatures are unique to Fortinet and play an critical role in the fight against advanced persistent threats (APTs).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">The section below provides a summary of the files analyzed by FortiCloud Sandbox during the last period.</span></p><fazchart mkey=\"Apprisk-Ctrl-Zero-Day-Detected-On-Network\" title=\" \" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><em>Figure 11: Zero-day malware detected on the network by the on-box AntiVirus scanning, sorted by count</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Files analyzed by FortiCloud Sandbox during the last period:</span></p><fazchart mkey=\"Apprisk-Ctrl-Files-Analyzed-By-FortiCloud-Sandbox\" title=\" \" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><em>Figure 12: Files analyzed by FortiCloud Sandbox</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">The list below provides some examples of the malicious files detected by FortiCloud Sandbox.</span></p><fazchart mkey=\"Apprisk-Ctrl-Malicious-Files-Detected-By-FortiCloud-Sandbox\" title=\" \" width=\"100%\"></fazchart><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><em>Figure 13: Examples of malicious files detected by FortiCloud Sandbox</em></span></p><div style=\"page-break-after: always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div><h1>Files/File Types &nbsp;Transferred by Applications</h1><p><span style=\"font-size:12px\">Applications that have ability to transfer files can pose a significant risk of data loss: company&rsquo;s customer data, intellectual property and confidential business trade secrets can be sent out of the organization via these applications.
