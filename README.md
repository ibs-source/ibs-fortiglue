# Fortiglue
#### _Sync tool for ITGlue&Fortinet_

## Getting Started

With these instructions you will be able to setting up your system to run a container on your server. See deployment's notes to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

I recommend using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run the script as the container is updated according to the machine versions.
The container do not require any specified configuration because the software works like an automatic tool.
